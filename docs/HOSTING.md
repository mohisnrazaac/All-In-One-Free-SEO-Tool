# Hosting

Pick one provider — all-in-one. The app is a single Docker container with one
persistent volume (`/data` for SQLite). No Redis, no separate database, no
queues required until you cross ~50 paying users.

## Hetzner Cloud — best price/performance

Recommended for 50-1000 users. ~$28/mo for a CCX23 (4 vCPU dedicated,
16 GB RAM, 160 GB SSD, 20 TB egress).

1. Create a Hetzner account → Project → Servers → "Add Server".
2. Choose image: **Docker CE on Ubuntu 22.04**. Type: **CCX23** (or CX22 for
   smaller scale). Add SSH key.
3. SSH in: `ssh root@your-server-ip`
4. ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mohisnrazaac/All-In-One-Free-SEO-Tool.git
   cd All-In-One-Free-SEO-Tool
   docker compose up -d
   ```
5. Point your domain's A record at the server IP.
6. Add Caddy or Nginx in front for SSL — easiest:
   ```bash
   docker run -d --name caddy \
     -p 80:80 -p 443:443 \
     -v caddy_data:/data \
     -e DOMAIN=seo.yourdomain.com \
     caddy caddy reverse-proxy --from seo.yourdomain.com --to localhost:3000
   ```

Backup: `docker run --rm -v seo_seo-data:/data -v $(pwd):/backup ubuntu tar czf /backup/seo-backup.tar.gz /data`

## Railway — easiest managed deploy

Recommended for 0-200 users when you want zero ops.

1. Push the repo to GitHub.
2. railway.app → New Project → Deploy from GitHub repo.
3. Railway auto-detects the `Dockerfile`. Add a persistent **Volume** mounted
   at `/data`.
4. Set env vars under Settings:
   - `SEO_DB_PATH=/data/data.db`
   - `APP_PASSWORD=<your-password>` (optional)
   - Any OAuth / AI keys you want pre-baked
5. Add a custom domain (Settings → Domains).

Cost: ~$5/mo Hobby plan ≈ 512 MB RAM (tight, fine for solo use). $20+ Pro for
real traffic.

## Hostinger VPS — cheapest

Recommended for tinkerers comfortable with manual ops.

1. Hostinger → VPS Hosting → KVM 2 (2 vCPU, 8 GB) for $7/mo or KVM 4
   (4 vCPU, 16 GB) for ~$15/mo on the 24-month plan.
2. Choose OS template: **Ubuntu 22 with Docker**.
3. SSH in, then same as Hetzner steps 4-6 above.

Catch: shared CPU on the cheapest tiers (KVM 1) means Playwright workloads
can stall under contention. KVM 2 or higher.

---

## DigitalOcean — middle ground

1. New Droplet → **Marketplace → Docker on Ubuntu 22.04**.
2. Size: 8 GB RAM / 4 vCPU ($48/mo) is the sweet spot.
3. Same Docker compose steps as Hetzner.

Or use **DigitalOcean App Platform** with the Dockerfile and a connected
managed Postgres database — easier but more expensive (~$75/mo).

## Self-hosted on your own computer — £0, and the most private

Use the README's Docker option. The tool runs entirely on
`localhost:3000`. No data leaves your machine unless you explicitly
connect Google APIs or an external AI provider.

Costs: nothing. The catch is that it's only reachable from that machine,
and only while it's switched on.

### Reaching it from your phone, still free

**Cloudflare Tunnel** is the simplest way, needs no open ports on your
router, and gives you HTTPS:

```bash
# One-time: install cloudflared, then
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:3000
```

That prints a public `*.trycloudflare.com` URL. For something permanent,
create a named tunnel and point a domain at it — still free.

**Tailscale** is the alternative if you'd rather it stay private: your
devices see the tool, the public internet never does.

**Set `APP_PASSWORD` before you expose it either way.** A tunnel makes
your install reachable by anyone who learns the URL, and without a
password they can use it.

Good for: personal SEO, one or two client sites, anyone who'd rather own
their data outright. The limitation is real though — scheduled audits,
rank checks and the daily agent only run while your computer is awake.
If you want the automation to actually be automatic, you need something
that stays on.

## Genuinely free, always on

**Oracle Cloud Always Free** is the only major cloud with a free tier
that fits this tool: up to 4 ARM cores and 24 GB RAM, a persistent disk,
and no expiry. That is far more than this needs — a 1 GB VPS runs it
fine.

Install Docker on the instance and follow the Hetzner steps above; they
are identical from that point. Open port 443, put Cloudflare in front,
set `APP_PASSWORD`.

Two honest caveats: ARM capacity in popular regions is often
unavailable, so you may have to retry or pick a quieter region; and
Oracle's signup asks for a card for identity even on the free tier.

**Railway** gives $5 of monthly credit, which this tool will roughly
consume — expect a small bill rather than free. **Render** runs Docker
with a real free tier, but persistent disks are a paid add-on, and
without one your database is wiped on every deploy. **Fly.io no longer
has a free tier** as of 2026 — new accounts get a short trial, then
roughly $2-5/month.

## Vercel + Supabase / Neon — why this doesn't work

Worth stating plainly, because it's the obvious thing to try and it
would waste an afternoon.

**Vercel can't run this.** Not a configuration problem — four separate
blockers:

1. **The database is a file.** `better-sqlite3` opens `data.db` in WAL
   mode on local disk. Vercel's filesystem is ephemeral and each request
   may hit a different container, so your data would vanish between
   requests.
2. **Playwright.** Rank checks, SERP scraping and GBP scraping drive a
   real headless Chromium. It doesn't fit in a serverless function.
3. **The scheduler needs a process that stays alive.** Audits, rank
   checks, monitoring and the daily agent are started from
   `instrumentation.ts` at boot. Serverless has no always-on process, so
   nothing would ever run on a schedule — which is most of the point.
4. **`output: "standalone"`** builds a self-contained server for a
   container, not Vercel's runtime.

**Supabase and Neon are PostgreSQL**, and this app is SQLite — see
"When to migrate to PostgreSQL" below for what that actually costs. They
are excellent databases; they're just not a drop-in here.

If you want it hosted and free, use Oracle Cloud Always Free. If you want
it hosted and effortless, a $5 VPS is the shortest path.

## After deploy — production hardening

1. **Cloudflare in front** (free) — point your domain through Cloudflare. Saves
   60-80% of bandwidth + adds DDoS protection + free SSL.
2. **Backup the SQLite file** — daily cron:
   ```bash
   sqlite3 /data/data.db ".backup /backups/$(date +%F).db"
   ```
3. **Set `APP_PASSWORD`** in the env so the UI is gated. Without it, anyone
   who finds the URL can use the tool.
4. **Cap browser concurrency** in Settings → Browser if you hit RAM pressure.
   Default 2 fits in ~1 GB; raise to 4 on a 4+ GB machine.
5. **Enable Playwright proxy rotation** if you scrape SERPs at volume —
   Settings → Browser → paste proxy list.

## When to migrate to PostgreSQL

Stay on SQLite while:
- You're the only user, OR
- You have <50 active users with <30 concurrent requests at peak.

Consider PostgreSQL when:
- You see `SQLITE_BUSY` errors in production logs.
- Daily-agent runs take >30 minutes (writes are queuing).
- You want to run 2+ app instances behind a load balancer.

**It is not a config swap.** This page used to say "a `DATABASE_URL` env
var + the drizzle config swap — about 1 day of work". That was wrong, and
measured rather than guessed:

- **72** tables are declared with `sqliteTable` from `drizzle-orm/sqlite-core`
- **42 of 62** migrations use SQLite-only SQL — `AUTOINCREMENT`,
  `unixepoch()`, `PRAGMA`
- `src/db/client.ts` opens a `better-sqlite3` handle and sets WAL mode
- Drizzle's SQLite and Postgres builders are different modules with
  different types, so the schema file is a rewrite, not an edit

Drizzle does support both, and the *shape* of the schema carries over.
But this is a port measured in weeks, not a day. Nobody has done it, so
treat any estimate — including this one — as an estimate.
