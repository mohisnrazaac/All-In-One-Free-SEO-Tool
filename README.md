## 💰 How much you save

A typical SEO professional pays **₹25,000-₹45,000 per month** ($300-$540) for tools. This one replaces all of them — for ₹0.

### Solo freelancer SEO stack (real prices, 2026)

| Tool you're paying for | What it does | Cost / month |
|---|---|---|
| Semrush Pro | Keyword research, rank tracking, audits | **₹11,700** ($140) |
| Surfer SEO Essential | Content briefs, content score | **₹7,400** ($89) |
| BrightLocal Single | Local SEO, citation tracking | **₹3,300** ($39) |
| Frase | AI content writer | **₹3,800** ($45) |
| ChatGPT Plus | AI assistant | **₹1,700** ($20) |
| **TOTAL** |  | **₹27,900 / month** |
| | | **₹3.35 lakh / year** |
| **This tool replaces all 5** | | **₹0 / month** ✅ |

### Small agency stack

| Tool | Cost / month |
|---|---|
| Ahrefs Lite | **₹10,800** ($129) |
| Semrush Pro | **₹11,700** ($140) |
| Surfer SEO Advanced | **₹18,300** ($219) |
| BrightLocal Multi | **₹6,600** ($79) |
| Frase Team | **₹9,600** ($115) |
| Reporting tool (AgencyAnalytics) | **₹6,300** ($75) |
| **TOTAL** | **₹63,300 / month** |
| | **₹7.6 lakh / year** |
| **This tool replaces all 6** | **₹0 / month** ✅ |

> *Prices accurate as of February 2026. Ahrefs / Semrush / Surfer publish official pricing on their sites — what you actually pay can be higher with add-ons (extra users, extra projects, AI credits).*

> **Where this genuinely replaces them, and where it doesn't.**
>
> A lot of what those tools charge for *is* free data they repackage — Search Console, Analytics, PageSpeed, Trends and autocomplete are all Google APIs you can call yourself, and that's exactly what this does. Site audits, technical SEO, rank tracking, content tooling, reporting and client management are all fully covered here.
>
> Two things are **not** free data, and you should know that before you switch:
>
> - **Backlink index.** Ahrefs and Semrush operate their own web crawlers, and that index is the single biggest thing you pay them for. This tool uses Search Console's backlink data (your own sites only) plus Common Crawl — useful, but not a substitute for a commercial index. If backlink research is core to your work, keep a paid tool or pair this with the free Ahrefs Webmaster Tools.
> - **Exact keyword search volumes.** There is no free source for real monthly volumes. This tool gives you a directional estimate from Trends, autocomplete and SERP signals, and shows you the raw inputs so you can judge it — it does not invent a number and present it as fact.
>
> Everything else, you can stop paying for.

## ⚡ Install in one command

No Git. No Node knowledge. No setup wizard. The installer auto-detects Docker / Node, finds a free port, runs migrations, builds for production, and opens your browser.

### 🪟 Windows (PowerShell)
```powershell
iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mohisnrazaac/All-In-One-Free-SEO-Tool/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

### 🐧🍎 macOS / Linux
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mohisnrazaac/All-In-One-Free-SEO-Tool/main/install.sh | bash
```

### 🐳 Docker manually
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mohisnrazaac/All-In-One-Free-SEO-Tool.git && cd All-In-One-Free-SEO-Tool
docker compose up -d
```

Open <http://localhost:3000>. That's it.

### 💻 Running it on your own PC (free, and the most private)

The commands above are the whole thing — the tool runs at
`localhost:3000` and your data never leaves the machine. A single
`data.db` file holds everything; backing up means copying the folder.

Two things worth knowing:

- **It only runs while your computer is on.** Scheduled audits, rank
  checks and the daily agent stop when you shut down. Fine for personal
  SEO; not fine if you want the automation to be automatic.
- **Reaching it from your phone** takes one command and stays free —
  `cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:3000` gives you an HTTPS
  URL with no router changes. **Set `APP_PASSWORD` first**, or anyone
  with the link can use your install.

Fully offline is supported too: install [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) for
local AI, and everything except SERP scraping and Google APIs works with
no internet at all.

### ☁️ Running it online for free

**[Oracle Cloud Always Free](docs/HOSTING.md)** is the one major cloud
whose free tier genuinely fits: a persistent disk, no expiry, and far
more RAM than this needs. Install Docker and follow the same steps.

A **$5/month VPS** (Hetzner CX11) is the shortest path if you'd rather
not fight for free ARM capacity. Full walkthroughs for Hetzner, Oracle,
Railway, Hostinger and DigitalOcean are in
**[docs/HOSTING.md](docs/HOSTING.md)**.

> **Vercel + Supabase or Neon won't work** — worth saying plainly,
> because it's the obvious thing to try. The database is a local SQLite
> file, rank checking drives a real headless browser, and the scheduler
> needs a process that stays alive; none of those survive a serverless
> runtime, and Supabase and Neon are PostgreSQL while this is SQLite.
> [The full reasoning is here.](docs/HOSTING.md#vercel--supabase--neon--why-this-doesnt-work)

### 99 dedicated tools, organized by SEO discipline
![All Tools page showing 13 category filters — Audits & scoring, Reports, On-page, Schema, Indexing, Speed, Keywords & content, Backlinks & outreach, Local SEO, Competitors & brand, AI visibility, Imports & integrations — and a grid of tool cards including Full SEO health check, SERP feature tracker, Content attack brief, Meta tag generator, SEO code generator](docs/screenshots/03-all-tools.png)

One chat for every SEO topic — the AI auto-focuses on the right specialty (technical, on-page, AI visibility, schema, local, hreflang, CWV, and 20+ more). Drop in an image for image-SEO analysis.

### AI blog writer with client-aware briefs
![AI blog writer for Acme Coffee Co. showing topic suggestions like 'Buyer's guide: how to pick the right product for your needs' and 'Common mistakes when buying' alongside a brief form with target keyword 'best espresso machines under 500', supporting keywords, tone, audience, and length controls](docs/screenshots/05-ai-blog-writer.png)

Generates ~1200-word SEO-optimized posts. Topic suggestions are pulled from your client's real Search Console data when connected.

### Ad Funnel Architect — multi-platform paid-ads strategy
![Ad Funnel Architect with platform checkboxes for Meta, Google Search, Google Display, Google Shopping, LinkedIn, TikTok, and YouTube Ads; configured for an Acme CRM B2B SaaS targeting marketing managers with a $1000/mo lead-gen budget](docs/screenshots/06-ad-funnel-architect.png)

Pick your platforms, set your budget, describe your audience — get a ready-to-paste funnel: awareness → consideration → conversion. Platform-specific ad copy with character limits respected.

### And there's a global overview, too

> Google AI Overviews now appear on **47% of commercial queries** ([Semrush AI Overview study, 2025](https://www.semrush.com/blog/google-ai-overviews-study/)). Gartner projects a **25% organic-traffic drop by 2028** ([Gartner 2024 prediction](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2024-02-19-gartner-predicts-search-engine-volume-will-drop-25-percent-by-2026-due-to-ai-chatbots-and-other-virtual-agents)). Most SEO tools haven't caught up. This one has.

✅ LLM mention tracker — weekly checks across ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, Gemini, Google AI Overviews  
✅ **Citation landscape** — the domains getting cited for your topics, ranked, with your own share. The question the paid GEO tools sell on: *who is being cited instead of me*  
✅ **Counts only answers where the model actually searched the web.** Every check records whether it searched or answered from training memory, and memory answers are excluded — they describe what a model absorbed months ago, not what AI search cites today. Most tools in this category don't draw the distinction  
✅ **Says when the sample is too small.** A ranking built from three answers is labelled as such, not presented as a share of voice  
✅ Reddit monitoring for brand + competitor mentions  
✅ AI-bot crawl tracking from server logs (GPTBot, ClaudeBot, PerplexityBot, OAI-SearchBot frequency)  
✅ `llms.txt` manager (generate, validate, monitor — emerging web standard)  
✅ robots.txt AI-bot policy builder (decide which AI bots to allow/block)  
✅ AI Overview presence tracker per query  
✅ Optimization suggestions (chunkable content, factual structure, citation-worthy formatting)  
✅ GEO/AEO (Generative Engine Optimization / Answer Engine Optimization) tactics built-in

### 📍 Local SEO
✅ Google Business Profile manager (direct GBP API integration)  
✅ Review hub — aggregates Google, Yelp, TripAdvisor, Trustpilot, Facebook  
✅ Citation tracker across 50+ niche directories  
✅ NAP-consistency checker  
✅ Local rank tracker by physical location within city  
✅ Local pack visibility (3-pack tracking)  
✅ Service-area page generator for multi-location businesses  
✅ Local schema templates by business type (Restaurant, Lawyer, Plumber, Dentist, Salon, etc.)  
✅ GBP photos manager + scheduler  
✅ GBP posts scheduler  
✅ Geo-IP testing — see how your site appears from different locations

### 💼 Paid ads (Ads Funnel Architect)
✅ Multi-platform support — Meta, Google Search / Display / Shopping, LinkedIn, TikTok, YouTube  
✅ Funnel-stage planner (awareness → consideration → conversion → retention)  
✅ Ad-copy generator with platform-specific rules (character limits, CTA conventions)  
✅ Keyword research for Google Ads  
✅ Landing-page audit for ads (Quality Score / Relevance prediction)  
✅ ROAS calculator + budget allocator  
✅ Image-prompt generator for ad creatives

### 📑 Reports & client management
✅ **Generate every client's report in one run** — pick clients, pick a template, one button  
✅ **Review queue** — batches produce drafts. Nothing reaches a client until you've read it and approved it, and sending delivers the exact PDF you approved rather than a fresh render  
✅ White-label PDF reports with your branding (logo, color, footer)  
✅ AI-generated executive summary (formula: [Direction] + [Win] + [Priority])  
✅ Report templates (Executive, Detailed, Technical, Local, E-commerce, Custom)  
✅ Scheduled monthly delivery via email, signed with your agency's details  
✅ Client portal with magic-link access — fully white-labelled, `noindex`, no app chrome  
✅ Invoice generator (₹INR + UPI / $USD) — 1-page A4, branded  
✅ Manual data inputs (outreach, links built, comments) integrated into reports  
✅ Work-completed-this-month auto-populated from completed tasks

### 💼 Winning the work
✅ **Embeddable audit widget** — one iframe on your site. Prospects grade their own domain, see what's wrong, and leave an email  
✅ **Leads inbox** — every lead arrives with a score and the actual findings, so your first reply writes itself. One click turns a lead into a client  
✅ **Proposal generator** — turns an audit into a document someone signs. Scope derived from real findings; you set the pricing  
⚠️ Deliberately no traffic, ranking or revenue forecasts in proposals — a crawl can't support them, and a proposal is the one document a client keeps and holds you to

### 🛠️ Tasks & workflow
✅ Today / This week / This month views  
✅ Kanban + List + Calendar views  
✅ Niche-aware task templates (Local, E-commerce, SaaS, Blog, Services)  
✅ Tech-stack-aware overrides (WordPress, Shopify, Next.js, Webflow, Wix)  
✅ Auto-task generation from audit findings  
✅ Recurring task scheduler  
✅ Time tracking per task  
✅ Comments + attachments + completion log

### 🤖 Automations & the autonomous agent
✅ **Autopilot** — the agent plans work from your audits, applies fixes, verifies them by re-reading the page, and turns everything it can't fix into tasks  
✅ **Four autonomy levels**, defaulting to the cautious one: off · suggest only · fix the obvious things · full autopilot. "Suggest only" never touches a live site  
✅ **Every change is reversible** — the previous value is read from the CMS before writing, and one click puts it back. If the previous value can't be read, the change doesn't happen  
✅ **"Applied" and "verified" are different states** — a CMS accepting a change isn't the same as it taking effect, and the UI shows which  
✅ **Five things it fixes on its own**: page titles · meta descriptions · image alt text (one action per image, not per page) · schema markup · **internal links to orphan pages**  
✅ **Orphan-page linking** — finds pages nothing on your site links to, picks the most relevant existing page, and links it using a phrase already in that article. No model invents the anchor text, so it can't write words you didn't. Body edits need review unless you turn autonomy all the way up  
✅ Guardrails: changes-per-run, changes-per-day, and a cooldown so it can't thrash the same page  
✅ Full audit trail — what it did, why, what it looked like before  
✅ **Daily agent runs ~17 automated jobs per client every day** — rank checks, audit deltas, content decay, backlink scans, GBP monitoring, alert generation  
✅ Workflow builder (drag-and-drop trigger → conditions → actions)  
✅ Pre-built workflow templates  
✅ Page change monitoring (alert on meta / H1 / title changes)  
✅ Custom monitors (brand mentions, SERP feature changes)  
✅ Webhook endpoints (incoming + outgoing)  
✅ Notification rules (Slack / Discord / Teams / email)

### 🧩 Use it from Claude, Cursor, or any MCP client
✅ **Built-in MCP server** — point Claude Code, Claude Desktop or Cursor at your install and ask questions in plain English against your own data ([setup](docs/mcp-server.md))  
✅ **Ten tools**, backed by the joined history — crawl findings, rank movements, AI citations and every change the agent made, in one place. Most SEO MCP servers wrap a single API; "why did this page drop last month" needs all of it  
✅ **It can act, and undo** — `run_agent` respects your autonomy setting exactly as the scheduler does, so at the default nothing is written to a live site  
✅ **Numbers arrive with their provenance.** A Search Console average and a browser scrape are different measurements, so movement between them is reported as *not comparable* rather than as a confident "up 6 places" that never happened  
✅ stdio only — no port, nothing listening, runs as whoever owns the database file  

### 🔌 Integrations
✅ **One setup page** (`/connect`) — every connection in one place, with what each one gets you, what you lose without it, how long it takes, and step-by-step instructions written for someone who's never seen that vendor's console  
✅ Nothing is required. The tool is fully usable with no keys at all  
✅ Google Search Console (free OAuth)  
✅ Google Analytics 4 (free OAuth)  
✅ Google Business Profile (free OAuth)  
✅ Bing Webmaster Tools  
✅ WordPress plugin — read/write meta, schema, redirects, alt text, robots.txt  
✅ Shopify integration  
✅ Webflow integration  
✅ Slack / Discord / Microsoft Teams webhooks  
✅ Email digests (SMTP)  
✅ **AI providers (BYO key, all optional):** OpenAI · Anthropic · Gemini · Groq · OpenRouter · DeepSeek · Perplexity · **Ollama (local, fully offline)**

### 🎨 Tech-stack-aware recommendations
> The killer feature most tools don't have. Every fix is tailored to YOUR site's CMS.

Detected automatically via Wappalyzer + HTTP signatures. Recommendations adapt per stack:

| Your stack | Example recommendation |
|---|---|
| WordPress + Astra theme + SiteGround | "Install LiteSpeed Cache + enable SG Optimizer caching at Site Tools → Speed" |
| Shopify + Dawn theme | "3 abandoned apps still loading scripts in Settings → Apps. Remove these 3." |
| Next.js 14 + Vercel | "Replace `<img>` with `next/image` on 8 detected pages. Add `priority` to LCP image." |
| Webflow | "Use Webflow's built-in SEO fields — 4 pages missing description." |
| Wix | "Wix has speed limits you can't fully fix. Here's what's controllable." |

### 🎓 Learn (built-in education)
✅ SEO basics course (12 interactive lessons, 3-5 min each)  
✅ Glossary — every term with hover tooltips throughout app  
✅ Tech-stack guides per platform  
✅ Best-practices library citing Google's actual documentation  
✅ Google algorithm-update tracker (pulls from Search Status Dashboard)

### 👥 Team (for agencies)
✅ **Accounts are opt-in** — one person on one laptop needs none, and nothing changes for them  
✅ Settings → Team: whoever registers first becomes the owner, everyone else joins by invite link  
✅ Four roles — owner, manager, member, client viewer  
✅ **Per-client access** — assign a member to three of your eighteen clients and that's all they see, everywhere: dashboard, tasks, reports, keywords. Typing another client's URL returns a 404, not a 403, so the roster itself stays private  
✅ Deactivate rather than delete, so their name stays on the work they did  
✅ Task completions, activity and tool runs record who did them  
⚠️ Invite links are shown for you to copy, not emailed — no SMTP setup needed to add a second person

### 🔐 Privacy & data ownership
✅ **All data in a single SQLite file on your machine** — no cloud sync, no telemetry, no phone-home, no analytics  
✅ API keys + OAuth tokens encrypted at rest (AES-256-GCM)  
✅ Passwords hashed with salted scrypt; sessions signed, 14-day expiry, revoked immediately on password change or deactivation  
✅ Backup = copy the install folder  
✅ Works fully offline with Ollama for AI  
✅ Default-bind to localhost — LAN exposure is opt-in via `APP_PASSWORD` or real accounts

## ❓ FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>Is this really free?</strong></summary>

Yes — fully self-hostable under the **[MIT License](LICENSE)**. No usage limits, no feature gates, no telemetry, no commercial restrictions. Use it for personal SEO, paid freelance client work, running an agency, building a paid SaaS on top, or anything else. The MIT license is one of the most permissive open-source licenses there is.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How does it work without paid API keys?</strong></summary>

The tool ships with a headless Chromium browser pool that scrapes Google, DuckDuckGo, and Bing for SERPs, autocomplete, related searches, and rank checks. Adding free Google API keys (GSC, GA4, PageSpeed — all free tiers, no credit card) makes it faster and more accurate, but isn't required.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I use this for client work as a freelancer or agency?</strong></summary>

Yes. Charging clients for your SEO services using this tool is completely allowed — that's not "selling the software," it's selling your service. You can white-label reports with your own brand, run it on your own infrastructure, and bill clients however you want.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How does it compare to Ahrefs / Semrush?</strong></summary>

Ahrefs and Semrush have larger backlink indexes and pay for premium SERP APIs at scale. This tool uses free Google APIs + headless browsers, which is slower at huge scale but free forever. For SEOs managing 1-25 client websites, the difference rarely matters — and you'll save ₹3-7 lakh/year ($3,000-$7,000).
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Does it run on a $5/month VPS?</strong></summary>

Yes. Tested on Hetzner CX11 (1 GB RAM). Daily agent + 5 clients with full rank tracking fits comfortably. The headless browser pool is the dominant resource — disable it in Settings if you only need audits + content tools.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I run this fully offline?</strong></summary>

Yes. Install [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) for local AI (Llama 3.2 / Phi-3 / Mistral). SERP scraping and Google API calls still need internet, but everything else — audits, content, schema, internal linking, reports — runs offline.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How is data stored?</strong></summary>

A single `data.db` SQLite file in your install folder. API keys and OAuth tokens are encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM. Backup = copy the folder. Migrate machines = copy the folder.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What about SEO Panel / SerpBear / SEOnaut / RustySEO?</strong></summary>

This tool absorbs the best ideas from each: SEO Panel's multi-client + white-label, SerpBear's rank tracking + GSC integration, SEOnaut's severity-classified audits, RustySEO's local AI + log analysis. Plus genuinely new pieces no other open-source tool has: LLM-citation tracking, ad-funnel architect, content decay detector, niche-aware task templates, tech-stack-aware recommendations.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Does it support non-English sites?</strong></summary>

Yes. Audits and rank tracking work for any country and language (country + BCP-47 language stored per client). Content generation respects the configured language. UI is English-only for now — translations welcome via PR.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What if my CMS isn't supported?</strong></summary>

The tool detects 2,500+ technologies via Wappalyzer. Tech-stack-aware recommendations exist for WordPress, Shopify, Next.js, Webflow, Wix, Squarespace, Laravel, custom PHP, and ~20 more. For anything else, you get generic recommendations + a "give my developer instructions" button that generates a clear ticket.

## 👋 Who built this?

**Built solo by [Prince Ramgarhia](https://github.com/IamRamgarhia) (DiceCodes)** — a full-stack developer based in Punjab, India, building products end-to-end.

This SEO platform exists because every existing tool either costs ₹10,000+/month or has critical gaps (no AI-search tracking, no integrated workflow, dated UI). Rather than pick one, I built the integrated tool I wanted as a freelance SEO myself: modern stack, free-first, privacy-first, tech-stack-aware.

**Other shipped work:**
- 🌐 [dicecodes.com](https://dicecodes.com) — portfolio + past projects
- 🧾 [Free GST Billing Software](https://github.com/IamRamgarhia/Free-GST-Billing-Software) — open-source invoicing for Indian small businesses

**Why trust a solo project over established SaaS?**
- The full source is here — read it, audit it, fork it
- Issues + PRs get a same-week response (solo dev = no support-tier roulette)
- **MIT license** guarantees the tool stays free for everyone forever — even if DiceCodes vanishes tomorrow, anyone can continue, fork, or commercialise it

## 📜 License

**[MIT License](LICENSE)** — one of the most permissive open-source licenses in existence.

### ✅ You CAN, freely:
- Self-host for your own SEO work (any scale)
- Use it for paid freelance / agency client work
- Modify, fork, and adapt the code
- **Sell** the software or a modified version
- Offer it as a **paid hosted SaaS**
- Re-license your fork under any license you want
- Bundle it inside a commercial product

### Only requirements:
- Keep the MIT copyright + permission notice in copies / substantial portions
- That's it. No other strings attached.

A maintainer credit + "support this project" donation prompt is included in the app, but neither is a license requirement — you can strip them in your fork. Asking nicely: leaving the credit in place helps other SEOs find the project.
